==========================

<b>Features:</b>
	
	- Very FAST!, expecially with Teensy 3.x where uses hyper fast SPI.
	- It uses just 4 or 5 wires.
	- Compatible at command level with Adafruit display series so it's easy to adapt existing code.
	- It uses the standard Adafruit_GFX Library (you need to install). 
	- SPI transaction compatible (only where supported, actually only Teensy3 but soon more)
	- Working with IDE 1.0.6, 1.5.8 (or newer), Energia (soon)
	- Working with Arduino's (8 and 32 bit), Teensy 3, Teensy 3.1 and Teensy LC
	- Working with Energia supported MCU (not yet but really soon)
	- A Fast SPI DMA for Nucleo F411RE porting from MasudaNaika https://github.com/MasudaNaika

<b>Pay Attention to connections!!!!:</b>
	
	- This display has logic at 3V3 volt so YOU NEED A VOLTAGE CONVERTER if you plan to use with arduino.
	If you try to connect directly you can burn it very fast so PAY ATTENTION!
	- My display works at 3V3 volt and uses 3V3 for logic but LED background has resistor for 5V. 
	Your can be different so carefully check out before connect it.
	- Library works only in SPI mode by using MOSI,SCLK and a CS pin plus an additional pin for DC (or RS).
	I've used also the reset pin but you can save it by connect it at 3V3 volt and use the constructor without
	the reset pin. The initialization routine will automatically use the software reset.

	- People using Teensy3 should remember that have to choose for CS and DC a pin that should be:
	pins:2,6,9 or 10,15 or 20,13 for CS and DC, any for RST (but you can connect RST to +3v3 and forget it.

<b>Backgrounds:</b>
	
	I got one of those displays from a chinese ebay seller but unfortunatly I cannot get
	any working library so I decided to hack it. ILI9163C looks pretty similar to other 
	display driver but it uses it's own commands so it's tricky to work with it unlsess you
	carefully fight with his gigantic and not so clever datasheet.
	My display it's a 1.44"", 128x128 that suppose to substitute Nokia 5110 LCD and here's the 
	first confusion! Many sellers claim that it's compatible with Nokia 5110 (that use a philips
	controller) but the only similarity it's the pin names since that this one it's color and
	have totally different controller that's not compatible. Altrough I discovered that it's not
	128x128 but 128x160 (!??)... Check links below to see if it's similar to yours.

	This TFT it's really cheap but has surprising features since it support very high speed SPI trasfer 
	(over 40Mhz tested!) and can be used as frame buffer, colors are quite tunable and has a tons of settings.
	It also support repetitive serial transfer so it can react very fast.
	
<b>BLACK, RED or ...</b>
	
	There's different strain of this display on ebay, I have try to tracking all of them but may missing some 		species! Actually the more popular has a RED pcb and a BLACK pcb that are completely same pcb but mount a 		different display that need some tweaking, in particular RED ones need offset but also some tweak for 			colors, etc. In the .h file in the library try to comment out one of the presets:
	//#define __144_RED_PCB__
	#define __144_BLACK_PCB__
	//#define __22_RED_PCB__
	I have a discussion here where a couple of users claim that the _GRAMHEIGH propriety should be always 128.
	This is true ONLY if you will never use scroll! Scroll use the entire memory mapped to screen, my RED tag one
	it's 128x128 but it uses 128x160! If during scroll you have some garbage means that you have not correctly
	setup the display property:
	
	#define _TFTWIDTH  		128//the REAL W resolution of the TFT
	#define _TFTHEIGHT 		128//the REAL H resolution of the TFT
	#define _GRAMWIDTH      	128
	#define _GRAMHEIGH      	160//Heh? Yes! My display uses offset!
	#define _GRAMSIZE		_GRAMWIDTH * _GRAMHEIGH //
	#define __COLORSPC		1// 1:GBR - 0:RGB
	#define __GAMMASET3		//uncomment for another gamma (1,2,3)
	#define __OFFSET		32//this is the offset of my display, 160 - 128 = 32
	
	You can write your own one by adding it in the .h file but let me know so I can add for other users.
	
<b>Code Optimizations:</b>
	
	The purpose of this library it's SPEED. I have tried to use hardware optimized calls
	where was possible and results are quite good for most applications.
	Of course it can be improved so feel free to add suggestions.

<b>Needed stuff you have to install first!!!</b>

	This library use Adafruit GFX library as all my TFT,OLED and LCD libraries:
	(Remember to update GFX library often to have more features with this and other library!)
	

https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit-GFX-Library
	
    	Since Adafruit are quite reluctant to update often I have a 100% compatible one that it's faster and has
    	more features, faster char rendering, ability to use different fonts etc.

https://github.com/sumotoy/Adafruit-GFX-Library

    	It's 100% compatible with the Adafruit one so don't worry about.
    	
<b>Wiring:</b>

	You are a newbie and need help? Here's:
	This display has 8 pin (at the time I'm writing this):
	
	TFT side   -------------------- microprocessor  
	- Vcc		-->		+3V3V(!!!!)
	- Gnd		-->		Gnd
	- CS		-->		CS pin (3v3 level!)
	- RST		-->		connect to a MCU pin or tie to +3V3
	- A0		-->		DC or RS pin (3v3 level!)
	- SDA		-->		Mosi (3v3 level!)
	- SCK		-->		Sclk (3v3 level!)
	- LED		-->		Some display need a resistor (see note below)
	
* Note about led:

Some display have an internal resistor to limit current, you see on the back of the display, following LED pcb
trace with your eyes and if you see a resistor (100 Ohm mine) you can connect this line directly to +5V.
But be careful <u>do not try connect to 5V before you check the presence of this resistor on pcb</u>, you can try first by using a resistor of 220 ohm, if the image looks very dark, try 100 and if still very dark, tie directly to 5v.

<b>Utility included:</b>

	Included you will find LCD Image Converter a free utility to convert in code a 24bit image.

	see example bigPicture.ino. 
	I have included datasheet as well.

<b>Special Thanks:</b>
	
	Thanks Adafruit for his Adafruit_GFX!
	Thanks to Paul Stoffregen for his beautiful Teensy3 and high speed SPI magic.
